# Excel-ent-RPG
Shitty tech demo using Excel as an RPG engine

## Mechanics
This horrible piece of technology is comprised of several layers:
* Expandable 4x4 tileset (tileSet)
* A small map for easy editing (sMap)
* An expanded map to offload some math (bMap)
* A textured map (tMap)
* And of course, finally the Game area (Game)
* (I had a .GS script to use rectangles as directional keys, but this can easily be replace)
